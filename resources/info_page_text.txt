[size=32]Application Description[/size]
This application provides semi-automated tracking of an elastomeric pillar across 
a sequence of images. The verified position data can then be used to calculate 
force values. The produced data can then be visualised as plots. This application 
is to be used alongside the elastomeric micropillar platform as described in: [size=10]

forces in hyphal invasion", Lab on a Chip, Vol. 17, No.21, pp. 3643-3653, 2017.


[size=32]Track Pillar Position[/size]
1. select folders containing image sequences (or drag and drop)
   - the images are read in alphabetical order
   - the channel must be orientated vertically in the images
2. the app predicts the pillar position in the first frame
3. the user verifies the predicted position
    [see below for keyboard/mouse controls]
4. the app tracks the position across the sequence of images
(position files (.csv) are exported to the same directory as the images)


[size=32]Verify Predicted Positions[/size]
1. select folders containing image sequences (or drag and drop)
2. select associated position file for each (or drag and drop)
    - files can be in .csv or .xml format
    - this can be adjusted at the bottom right of the file select window
3. the user verifies the positions
    [see below for keyboard/mouse controls]


[size=32]Calculate Forces[/size]
1. select a position file (or drag and drop)
    - files can be in .csv or .xml format
    - this can be adjusted at the bottom right of the file select window
2. select the x and y pixel position columns
3. adjust parameters needed for force calculation
    [see below for parameters]
(force files (.csv) are exported to the same directory as the position file)


[size=32]Generate Plots[/size]
1. select a force file (or drag and drop)
    - files can be in .csv or .xml format
    - this can be adjusted at the bottom right of the file select window
2. select each column from the file, and press continue
3. use the arrows to preview the 8 graphs available
4. adjust titles, plot types, and the y-axis range for each plot
5. select the file types and plots to be exported
(plot files (.svg/.png) are exported to a sub-directory alongside the force file)


[size=32]Keyboard Controls[/size]
Z  -  zoom into circle
X  -  hide centre cross
C  -  hide circle
A  -  toggle axis overlay
S  -  save current image    (.png file is exported to a sub-directory)
D  -  toggle auto-contrast
F  -  toggle bulk position adjustment of all following frames
←/↓/↑/→  -  move circle
Ctrl + ←/→  -  change frame
Ctrl + ↓/↑  -  change job


[size=32]Mouse Controls[/size]
Left Mouse  -  move circle
Scroll Up  -  increase circle radius
Scroll Down  -  decrease circle radius


[size=32]Force Calculation Parameters[/size]
Pillar Diameter
  -  The diameter of the micropillar
  -  Defaults of 7.3 µm and 5.4 µm
Pillar Height
  -  The height of the micropillar
  -  Default of 11.1 µm
Pillar Contact
  -  The height of contact on the micropillar
  -  Default of 5.55 µm (half way up the pillar)
Pixel Micron Ratio
  -  The number of pixels per micron in the data
  -  Calculate with: [number of pixels] / [distance in microns]
  -  Default of 10 pixels per micron
Young's Modulus (Default of 1.47)
  -  A value describing the material properties of the pillar
  -  Default of 5.55 (Young's Modulus of PDMS)
Poisson's Ratio (Default of 0.5)
  -  A value describing the material properties of the pillar
  -  Default of 0.5 (Poisson's Ratio of PDMS)
Frame Frequency
  -  The number of frames per second in the data
  -  Calculate with: [number of frames] / [number of seconds]
  -  Default of 0.13 fps
